⚠️ IMPORTANT: ADD YOUR LOGO ⚠️

To complete the setup of the Green Bites project, please follow these steps:

1. Save the Green Bites logo image that you provided (the one with the green 'G' with leaves)

2. Rename the image file to: logo.jpg

3. Copy/Move the logo.jpg file to the public folder:
   Path: greenbites/public/logo.jpg

4. The logo will automatically appear:
   - In the navigation bar
   - On the home page hero section
   - On the login page
   - As the browser favicon

If you don't have the logo image saved:
- The logo is the green 'G' with leaf design that was provided in the attachments
- It has "Green Bites" text in green
- The background is light green/yellow gradient

Once the logo is added, run:
npm run dev

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
